		<h3>DANCING</h3>

		<div class="hobby_content">
		<p>Dancing has always been the best thing to cheer me up and it really keeps me up to express myself on music. When you are watching a dance performance, there is no research to be done and there are no special methods or, tricks to be studied before you sit in your seat. The big secret that dance lovers have discovered is that there's no secret at all. It's your experience, and the interpretation of it is all yours.</p>
		<p>The combination of movement, gesture, costume, set design, music and lighting all work together to take you on a journey. The adventure begins the moment you sit down in the theatre and the lights begin to dim. Just like when you go travelling, throughout a performance, you may have many different experiences.</p>

		<p>Today more and more people, are adopting hiking and trekking as a major outdoor event. The trend of hiking and trekking is increasing in many parts of the world I went on my first hike a few years back while living in India. At the urging of my friends, we walked a beautiful forest trail on a cool August morning. If you can climb a mountain, you can do anything. While not technically true, the mantra still goes through my head constantly during a hike. Reaching the top of a mountain (any mountain) is an impressive physical, mental, and emotional accomplishment. And it is motivating. It reminds me I can accomplish important things with my life if I dream big and put in the work. And I fell in love with climbing mountains.</p>

		<h3>TRYING NEW DISHES</h3>

		<div class="hobby_content">
			<p>Being flexible and adventurous in what you eat is a mark of maturity and adaptability. Children are particular about what they eat and might lie about having allergies to foods they don't like; a man doesn’t do that. And think about the older men you know: They start to get set in their ways as time goes on, sticking to the same routines and eating the same things. That may be you one day, so to avoid regrets down the road, embrace your prime years by saying yes to everything. (And not just food. Say yes to going out with people you don't know, to places you've never been and to trying things you’ve been told are lame or dangerous.) Women — the kind of women you want — are attracted to guys with a sense of adventure, so don't wait for somebody else to suggest the kidney special.</p>

		<h3>COLLECTING BRAND TAGS</h3>

		<div class="hobby_content">
			<p>Why not? A woven cloth designer apparel label is like a badge of honor - something you endorse, support, cherish, wear, recommend or just look at. Remember when you bought this or that article of clothing or purse or scarf or headband? You will enjoy perusing your collection and planning what label to find and add next! A label collecting is a great excuse to buy that next article of vintage or new clothing. Have duplicate or unwanted labels? Then trade them with others for labels you don't have or want to collect. I have a website and blog ArmSkin.com being prepared especially for tattoo and label and personal ornamentation enthusiasts. Woven cloth designer labels can be used to embellish a sweater - shirt pocket - blouse - a jacket sleeve - a T-shirt - jeans - or just collected and displayed .... the list is endless. </p>

		<h3>WATCHING SOCCER ! FOR FC BARCELONA </h3>

		<div class="hobby_content">
			<p>FCB are more than a club. The style of play the players employ has won the respect and admiration from football fans from around the globe. At the same time, Barça has stayed true to its philosophy and values, as special attention is given to the youth teams and to social issues. Barça is an inclusive club, a club that’s deeply tied to its city and country, but also one that embraces its international status.Apart from winning Europe’s top title,, the Club also has the honour of being the only one to have appeared in every single edition of European club competition since the tournaments were first created back in 1955. Barcelona's many achievements in Europe include being considered 'King of the Cup Winners Cup', having won that title a record four timesIn addition, FC Barcelona also won three Fairs Cups (the tournament now known as the UEFA Cup) in 1958, 1960 and 1966. In 1971, Barça won that trophy outright in a match played between themselves, as the first ever winners of the competition, and Leeds United, as the last. </p>
